# Global Rules for AI (always applied)

## Language & Style
- Always use TypeScript strict mode; no "any".
- Prefer functional React components with hooks; no classes.
- Use Tailwind/NativeWind utility classes for styling; never inline styles except one-offs.

## Architecture
- Assume Expo + React Native Web (shared code). Create `.android.tsx`, `.ios.tsx`, or `.web.tsx` only when platform APIs diverge.
- Navigation = Expo Router file-based routing under /app.
- State = Zustand unless Redux Toolkit already exists.

## Size
- Keep every file under 300 LoC; if larger, suggest a refactor.
